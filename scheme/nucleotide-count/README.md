# Nucleotide Count

Welcome to Nucleotide Count on Exercism's Scheme Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Each of us inherits from our biological parents a set of chemical instructions known as DNA that influence how our bodies are constructed. All known life depends on DNA!

> Note: You do not need to understand anything about nucleotides or DNA to complete this exercise.

DNA is a long chain of other chemicals and the most important are the four nucleotides, adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine. A single DNA chain can contain billions of these four nucleotides and the order in which they occur is important!
We call the order of these nucleotides in a bit of DNA a "DNA sequence".

We represent a DNA sequence as an ordered collection of these four nucleotides and a common way to do that is with a string of characters such as "ATTACG" for a DNA sequence of 6 nucleotides.
'A' for adenine, 'C' for cytosine, 'G' for guanine, and 'T' for thymine.

Given a string representing a DNA sequence, count how many of each nucleotide is present.
If the string contains characters that aren't A, C, G, or T then it is invalid and you should signal an error.

For example:

```
"GATTACA" -> 'A': 3, 'C': 1, 'G': 1, 'T': 2
"INVALID" -> error
```

## Running and testing your solutions


### From the command line

Simply type `make chez` if you're using ChezScheme or `make guile` if you're using GNU Guile\.
Sometimes the name for the scheme binary on your system will differ from the defaults\.
When this is the case, you'll need to tell make by running `make chez chez=your-chez-binary` or `make guile guile=your-guile-binary`\.

### From a REPL

* Enter `(load "test.scm")` at the repl prompt\.
* Develop your solution in `nucleotide-count.scm` reloading as you go\.
* Run `(test)` to check your solution\.

### Failed Test Cases

If some of the test cases fail, you should see the failing input and the expected output\.
The failing input is presented as a list because the tests call your solution by `(apply nucleotide-count input-list)`\.
To learn more about `apply` see [The Scheme Programming Language -- Chapter 5](https://www.scheme.com/tspl4/control.html#./control:h1)
